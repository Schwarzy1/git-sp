git-sp
======

Git-sp is a script for simplifying the task of adding, commiting, and pushing
with git. sp stands for "simple push". It is meant to streamline pushing
minor changes, with simple messages such as "minor review change". 
Therefore, git-sp only allows for one of the many flags git-commit and
git-push allow. 

By use of git-sp, time and keypresses are saved. For example, instead of this:

------------------------------
git commit -m "message"
git push origin branch
------------------------------

We can use:

------------------------------
git sp "message"
------------------------------

This saves 22 key presses, plus the name of the current branch. 


Using git-sp
------------

To use git-sp, place git-sp in your PATH and invoke it like this:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
# commit and push files staged for commit with message "fixup"
git sp

# commit and push files staged for commit with custom message
git sp "message"

# stage all files for commit, and then commit and push them
git sp -a "message"

-------------------------------------------------------------------


Limitations:
------------

This script is intended to solve the problem of having to type multiple
commands to commit and push changed files. While git-add, git-commit, and
git-push all have many different settings, git-sp is intended to be
extremely simple. Git-sp will only push to the current working branch.
